Had to push the Wire Frames.pdf a third time because I noticed that for some reason the text in the sales portion of the hifi didn't 
show on the pdf even though it was there in Figma. I discovered that in the layers on the left of the screen it wasn't even alocated 
to any of the desktops. It was just off in limbo by itself. After moving it in the layers list to the desktop where it beloged, voila, 
now it shows up in the pdf.
